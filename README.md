This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Why Pixelity?
How many of you have an old smart phone lying around? Phones that can't seem to keep up with modern requirements. Pixelity allows you to make good use of it with a single click.
Pixelity allows you to sign up and use your old phone as a network attached storage, like your own personal cloud. This allows the user to backup all their pictures privately on their own old phone. With RSA encryption this makes the process safer. Our project requires no setup, it is ready out of the box and is easy for laymen to use. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
